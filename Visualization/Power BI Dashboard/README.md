**Story Behind the Project**
In today's fast-moving retail world, businesses need more than just numbers—they need insights. I took on the challenge of transforming complex supply chain data into a clear, interactive, and impactful dashboard that would help decision-makers understand where their business stands and where it's heading.

Using Power BI, I designed and developed a comprehensive Supply Chain Analysis Dashboard that acts like a control center for the company’s sales, inventory, and procurement data. The goal was to create a tool that doesn’t just show data but tells a story—one that empowers strategy, boosts efficiency, and supports smarter decisions.

🔍 What the Dashboard Shows
At the heart of the dashboard are three key metrics:

💰 Total Sales: $388M

📦 Total Inventory Value: $218M

🧾 Total Cost: $117M

These executive KPIs give stakeholders an instant snapshot of performance and cost efficiency.

But I didn’t stop at high-level numbers.

I built powerful visuals and interactive features to dive deeper into the story behind the data.

📊 Key Insights Uncovered
📈 Year-over-Year Sales Trends (YTD & QTD):
Tracked performance from 2019 to 2023. The data revealed strong growth from $79M (2019) to $97M (2022), followed by a noticeable dip in 2023 ($26M). This raised strategic questions: What changed in 2023? What can we adjust?

🌍 Region-Wise Sales Performance:
The West region led with $112M in sales, closely followed by the South at $99M. Lower numbers in the Midwest and Southwest pointed to opportunities for regional development and targeted marketing.

🎨 Product Category Analysis:
The Arts & Entertainment category stood out as the top performer with $91M in sales, followed by Photography and Music. This insight helps guide inventory planning and promotional focus.

💳 Purchase Method Preferences:
A pie chart revealed customer behavior—Credit Card usage dominated at 40%, while Cash, Debit, and Other methods were evenly split at 20% each. These insights can inform partnerships with payment providers and checkout optimizations.

🏬 Top 5 Store Performance:
Stores were ranked to identify high performers. Tilloch Store #799 led the list with $6.24M in sales, providing a benchmark for other locations.

📆 Month-over-Month Sales Growth:
April emerged as the peak month with $41M in sales. Understanding seasonal trends helps with forecasting and stock management.

🧩 Built for Exploration – Interactive Features
This wasn’t just a static report. The dashboard allowed users to:

Filter by year, region, and purchase method

Drill down to view performance by store, product, or month

View changing trends over time through interactive visuals

This empowered stakeholders to find their own answers and make fast, informed decisions.

📈 Business Impact
The dashboard helped the business:

Monitor performance in real-time across different years and regions

Identify underperforming zones and act with agility

Refine procurement based on product and purchasing trends

Plan more accurately using seasonal insights

Boost supply chain efficiency and reduce inventory holding costs
