**Supply Chain Analysis**


Tools Used: SQL, Power BI 

🔹 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a simulated supply chain dataset to extract key business insights related to sales performance, inventory health, and regional trends. I used SQL for data modeling and analysis, and built an interactive Power Bi dashboard to visualize KPIs for business decision-making.

🔹 Objectives
Track sales trends (MTD, QTD, YTD)

Analyze MoM and YoY growth

Evaluate inventory status (overstock, understock, out-of-stock)

Identify top-performing products, stores, and regions

Understand customer behavior based on purchase methods

🔹 Key Features
Dynamic metrics using SQL window functions and date functions

Inventory value and stock status classification

Sales breakdown by region, state, and store

Product-wise and method-wise sales contribution

Visual dashboard with daily, monthly, and yearly trends

🔹 SQL Techniques Used
Joins, aggregations, subqueries

Window functions: LAG(), ROUND(), GROUP BY, ORDER BY

Date-based filtering for MTD, QTD, YTD

CASE statements for stock classification

🔹 Outcome
Delivered a clean and insightful Excel dashboard

Built reusable SQL scripts for dynamic business queries

Strengthened skills in supply chain KPIs, inventory control, and trend analysis

📁 Files Used:

Fact tables: supply_chain_view, inventory_adjusted, sales

Dimension tables: calendar, customer, store, geojson

💡 This project demonstrates my ability to apply SQL and data visualization tools to solve real-world business problems in supply chain and operations analytics.
