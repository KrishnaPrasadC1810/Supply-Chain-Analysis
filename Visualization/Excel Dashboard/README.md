Hi! Let me walk you through a project I worked on called Supply Chain Analysis.

Imagine a big company that sells lots of products in different regions and through many stores. Managing all that — like tracking what’s selling, how much stock is left, what it costs, and how people are buying — is what supply chain analysis is all about.


🎯 Objective of the Project
The main goal was to:

Track sales, costs, and inventory value across multiple years

Identify the best-performing regions, products, and stores

Analyze customer purchase behavior

Support decision-making through visual, filterable data

📊 Data Preparation & Methodology
✅ Step 1: Data Cleaning
Imported raw data files into Excel

Removed duplicates, fixed missing values

Used structured tables for consistent data referencing

✅ Step 2: Data Analysis
Created Pivot Tables to summarize large datasets

Applied filters, calculated fields, and grouped data into years and months

✅ Step 3: Visualization
Built a clean and professional dashboard using:

Bar & Column Charts (for trends and comparisons)

Pie Charts (to show % contribution like payment methods)

Cards (for total sales, cost, inventory)

Slicers (for interactive filtering by year, region, method)

🔍 Key Metrics & Insights
💰 Executive KPIs
Total Sales: $388 Million

Total Cost: $117 Million

Total Inventory Value: $218 Million
These top-level numbers help the business understand revenue, spending, and stock health.

📈 Sales Trend (YTD / QTD)
From 2019 to 2022, sales steadily grew.

A slight dip was noted in 2023, which could prompt an investigation into market or operational changes.

🌍 Region-wise Sales
West region topped with $112M in sales

South and East followed closely

Midwest and Southwest showed lower performance → opportunity for targeted growth

🛒 Purchase Method Distribution
Other Payment Methods: 40%

Credit, Debit, and Cash: 20% each
This insight helps businesses tailor payment offerings to customer preferences.

📦 Product Type Sales
Arts & Entertainment was the highest-earning category ($91M)

Followed by Photography, Music, and Mobiles

Helps with inventory forecasting and marketing focus

🏪 Top Performing Stores
Tilloch Store #799 was the best-performing outlet with $6.24M in sales

Useful for store-level benchmarking and performance evaluation

📆 Monthly Sales Trend
April showed peak performance ($41M)

Helps identify seasonal trends for better planning and resource allocation

🧩 Interactivity Features
Slicers allow users to filter the data by:

Year (from 2019 to 2023)

Region

Purchase Method

This makes the dashboard dynamic and user-friendly, enabling managers to explore specific questions quickly.

💼 Business Impact & Outcome
By using this dashboard, decision-makers can:

Monitor performance in real-time

Reduce inventory costs by tracking unsold stock

Improve regional strategies by reallocating focus where needed

Plan future inventory based on historical sales trends

Enhance customer experience by understanding buying habits
