# Supply-Chain-Analysis-Project
The project aimed to enhance supply chain efficiency by analyzing data from multiple sources. I used SQL for data extraction, Excel for cleaning, and Power BI for visualization, creating an analytics solution that provided insights into inventory, sales trends, product categories, and regional metrics.


# 📖 Project Overview
This project focused on analyzing and improving supply chain efficiency by leveraging data from various sources. Using SQL for data extraction, Excel for data cleaning, and Power BI for visualization, I developed an end-to-end analytics solution that delivered clear insights into inventory performance, sales trends, product categories, and regional metrics.

# 🧾 Key Objectives
Track overall inventory value, sales, and procurement cost

Analyze year-over-year (YoY) and month-over-month (MoM) sales performance

Identify top-performing regions, stores, and product types

Understand purchase behavior based on payment methods

Enable interactive exploration of the data for better decision-making

# 🧩 Process & Tools
🔹 SQL (MySQL):

Extracted and queried data from relational databases

Performed data joins, aggregations, and filtering to prepare key metrics

Built datasets on inventory, orders, costs, and store performance

🔹 Excel:

Cleaned raw data using formulas, filtering, and validation tools

Applied pivot tables for exploratory analysis

Created summary tables for dashboard integration

🔹 Power BI:

Designed a fully interactive dashboard with slicers for Year, Region, and Purchase Method

Used Power Query for advanced data transformation

Developed calculated columns and measures using DAX (YTD, QTD, MoM metrics)

Visualized KPIs using cards, bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs

# 📊 Key Insights
Total Sales: $388M

Total Cost: $117M

Inventory Value: $218M

Top Region: West ($112M)

Top Product Category: Arts & Entertainment ($91M)

Top Store: Tilloch Store #799 ($6.24M)

Popular Payment Method: Other (40% of sales)

These insights helped identify sales opportunities, monitor inventory performance, and highlight seasonal demand cycles.

# ✅ Impact & Outcome
Enabled better inventory management and reduced holding costs

Supported sales strategy by identifying top categories and regions

Improved resource planning using trend forecasts and seasonal analysis

Empowered stakeholders with a real-time, interactive dashboard for data-driven decisions
